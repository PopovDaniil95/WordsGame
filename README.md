# WordsGame

Welcome to the repository of my Word Finder game! In this game, two players compete to find as many words as possible in a given long word. The primary criterion is to count the number of letters in the found word, rather than the number of words. There are specific rules that need to be followed during the game.

# Description

Key rules and features of the game:

Players are not allowed to enter words consisting of a single letter, as they are not considered valid options.

Duplicate words cannot be entered to ensure the uniqueness of each player's answers.

Players are also prohibited from entering the longest word, as the main objective is to find the maximum number of words based on the letter count.

At the end of the game, the total number of letters in all the words found by each player is calculated, and the winner is determined.
